# Locating and resolving errors

While working in a file, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, highlighting the sections that require a closer look. The system inspects both [programming](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html) and [natural](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/proofreading.html) languages, checking syntax, spelling, and grammar. All found problems are marked in the editor and duplicated in a variety of other places, allowing you to quickly locate and resolve the issue.
