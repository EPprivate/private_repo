# Locate, analyze, and resolve errors

IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, inspecting both [programming](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html) and [natural](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/proofreading.html) languages. The system highlights detected problems in the [editor](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/guided-tour-around-the-user-interface.html?keymap=primary_windows) and duplicates them in the **Problems** tool window, making proofreading easier.

You can work with errors directly in the editor, locating and resolving problems there. However, if you need to fix multiple mistakes, it is better to use the **Problems** tool window, since it displays a complete list of mistakes and provides a toolset for fixing errors in a more centralized way. 

For the sake of simplicity, all procedures described in the sections below are performed in the **Problems** tool window. For information on how to locate and fix mistakes in the editor, see corresponding sections.
