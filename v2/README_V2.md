# Locate, analyze, and resolve errors

IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, inspecting both [programming](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-inspection.html) and [natural](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/proofreading.html) languages. The system highlights found problems in the editor and duplicates them in the **Problems** tool window, making proofreading easier. 

You can work with errors directly in the editor, however, if you need to fix multiple errors, it is better to use the **Problems** tool window. It displays a complete list of mistakes and provides a toolset for fixing errors in a more centralized way.
