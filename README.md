# Reviewing code

While developing an application, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, highlighting the sections that require closer look. In addition to analyzing the code, the system also inspects the natural language, i.e., checks spelling and grammar. All found mistakes are higlighted in the editor, allowing you to quickly apply changes.

## Locating errors

In addition to highlighting errors in the editor, IntelliJ IDEA duplicates all related information in a variety of places. Errors are highlighted:

- Directly in the editor using red/green wavy lines
- As stripes on the scrollbar
- On the **Inspections** widget, located at the top of the scrollbar
- In the **Problems** tool window

The overall error statistics is located at the top-right corner of the editor. Clicking the toolbar opens the **Problems** tool window.
