# Reviewing code

While developing an application, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, highlighting the sections that require closer look. In addition to analyzing the code, the system also inspects the natural language, i.e., checks spelling and grammar. All found mistakes are higlighted in the editor, allowing you to quickly apply changes.
