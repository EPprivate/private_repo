# Reviewing code

While developing an application, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, highlighting the sections that require closer look. In addition to analyzing the code, the system also inspects the natural language, i.e., checks spelling and grammar. All found mistakes are marked in the editor, allowing you to quickly apply changes.

## Locating errors

Along with highlighting errors in the editor, IntelliJ IDEA duplicates all related information in a variety of places, making it easier to find and correct the mistakes. All relevant information is displayed:

![errors overview](https://github.com/EPprivate/private_repo/blob/main/images/errors%20overview.png?raw=true)

The **Inspections** widget, located at the top of the scrollbar, displays the overall amount of errors in the file.

Clicking the widget opens the **Problems** tool window.

### Inspecting errors in the editor

Errors in the editor are highlighted:

- As red/green wavy lines

  ![errors as wavy lines](https://github.com/EPprivate/private_repo/blob/main/images/errors%20as%20wavy%20lines.png?raw=true)
  
- As stripes on the scrollbar

  ![stripes on a scroll bar](https://github.com/EPprivate/private_repo/blob/main/images/stripes%20on%20a%20scroll%20bar.png?raw=true)
  
   > **Note:**
   > Typos are not shown on the scrollbar.

To get information about the error, hover the mouse over the wavy line/stipe on the scrollbar. A popup with details appears, allowing you to fix the mistake, or perform other actions.

### Inspecting errors in the Problems tool window

The **Problems** tool window displays a complete list of mistakes and provides a toolset for fixing errors in a more centralized way. Each listed problem has an explanation next to it and a number of the line where the error occured.

To locate a specific mistake in the editor, double-click the desired problem.
