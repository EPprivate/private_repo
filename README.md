# Reviewing code

While developing an application, IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code, highlighting the sections that require closer look. In addition to analyzing the code, the system also inspects the natural language, i.e., checks spelling and grammar. All found mistakes are marked in the editor, allowing you to quickly apply changes.

## Locating errors

Along with highlighting errors in the editor, IntelliJ IDEA duplicates all related information in a variety of places, making it easier to find and correct the mistakes. Errors are highlighted:

- Directly in the editor with red/green wavy lines

- As stripes on the scrollbar

- In the **Problems** tool window

  ![problems tab](https://github.com/EPprivate/private_repo/blob/main/images/problems%20tab.png?raw=true)

The overall error statistics is displayed on the **Inspections** widget, located at the top of the scrollbar. Clicking the widget opens the **Problems** tool window.
