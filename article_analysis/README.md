# Article Analysis: Multiple Selections

Looking through the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA documentation library, I've come across [this](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/pro-tips.html#multiple-selections) short article about the Multiple Selections feature.

At the first sight, the descriptions are looking correct and straight-forward. However, when you start reproducing them in IntelliJ IDEA, some procedures described in the instruction become unclear.
